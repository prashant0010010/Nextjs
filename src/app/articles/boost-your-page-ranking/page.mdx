/>

<h3>1. Keyword Optimization</h3>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Primary Keyword Placement:</strong> Your primary keyword, such as "on page seo," should be strategically placed in the title tag, meta description, headers, and throughout the content. Ensure that the keyword usage feels natural and not forced.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Supporting Keywords:</strong> Use secondary keywords like "on page seo ranking factors," "on page seo factors," and "on page off page seo" to diversify your content and capture related search queries.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>LSI Keywords:</strong> Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) keywords are terms that are related to your primary keyword. Incorporate these naturally into your content to enhance relevance.
</p>

<h3>2. Title Tags</h3>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Compelling Titles:</strong> The title tag is one of the most important On-Page SEO factors. It should be concise, include the primary keyword, and be compelling enough to encourage clicks.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Length:</strong> Keep the title tag under 60 characters to ensure it displays correctly in search results.
</p>

<h3>3. Meta Descriptions</h3>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Optimization:</strong> A well-written meta description can improve click-through rates (CTR). Include the primary keyword and make it compelling and informative.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Length:</strong> Keep the meta description between 150-160 characters to avoid truncation in search results.
</p>

<h3>4. Header Tags (H1, H2, H3)</h3>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>H1 Tag:</strong> The H1 tag should contain your primary keyword and clearly define the main topic of the page.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>H2 and H3 Tags:</strong> Use these subheadings to organize your content and include secondary keywords like "on page and off page seo factors" and "important on page seo factors."
</p>

<h3>5. Content Quality and Relevance</h3>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Original Content:</strong> Search engines prioritize unique and original content. Avoid duplicate content at all costs.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Length:</strong> Longer content tends to rank better, as it provides more value. Aim for a word count of 1,500 to 2,500 words for in-depth articles.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Keyword Density:</strong> While there&apos;s no exact formula, aim for a keyword density of around 1-2%. Overstuffing keywords can lead to penalties.
</p>

<h3>6. Internal Linking</h3>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Strategic Placement:</strong> Internal links help distribute link equity throughout your site and guide users to related content. Use keywords as anchor text when linking to other pages within your site.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Navigation:</strong> Proper internal linking enhances site navigation and helps search engines crawl your site more efficiently.
</p>

<h3>7. URL Structure</h3>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>SEO-Friendly URLs:</strong> Your URLs should be concise, include the primary keyword, and be easy for both users and search engines to understand.

  style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto", marginBottom: "20px" }}
/>

<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Hyphens Over Underscores:</strong> Use hyphens to separate words in URLs, as search engines treat underscores differently.
</p>

<h3>8. Image Optimization</h3>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Alt Text:</strong> Use descriptive alt text for images, incorporating the primary keyword when relevant. This helps with accessibility and image search optimization.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>File Size:</strong> Compress images to improve page load speed, a critical factor for both SEO and user experience.
</p>

<h3>9. Mobile Friendliness</h3>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensure your website is mobile-friendly, as mobile-first indexing is now a standard practice for search engines like Google.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Usability:</strong> Mobile users should have a seamless experience navigating your site, with easy access to content and a clear call to action.
</p>

<h3>10. Page Load Speed</h3>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Optimization:</strong> Page speed is a crucial ranking factor. Compress images, minimize CSS and JavaScript, and use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to enhance load times.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Core Web Vitals:</strong> Focus on improving Core Web Vitals metrics, such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
</p>

<h3>11. User Engagement</h3>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Dwell Time:</strong> The longer users stay on your page, the better. Create engaging content that encourages users to spend more time on your site.
</p>
<p className="text-justify">
  <strong>Bounce Rate:</strong> A high bounce rate can negatively impact rankings. Ensure your content is relevant and your site is easy to navigate.
