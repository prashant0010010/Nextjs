    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p className="text-justify">
      On-page SEO is a fundamental aspect of digital marketing that directly impacts your website&apos;s visibility and ranking on search engines. However, many businesses unknowingly commit common on-page SEO mistakes that hinder their online growth. This guide will help you identify these mistakes, understand their impact, and learn how to fix them.
    </p>

    <h2>Common On-Page SEO Mistakes</h2>
    <h3>1. Ignoring Keyword Research</h3>
    <p className="text-justify">
      One of the biggest <strong>common SEO mistakes</strong> is neglecting proper keyword research. Keywords are the foundation of SEO as they help search engines understand the content of your pages. Without targeting the right keywords, your content may not reach your intended audience.
    </p>
    <h4>How to Avoid This Mistake:</h4>
    <ul className="text-justify">
      <li>
        Use keyword research tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or SEMrush to find relevant keywords with a good balance of search volume and competition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Focus on long-tail keywords that are more specific and have less competition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Regularly update your keyword list based on current trends and search behaviors.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Poorly Optimized Title Tags and Meta Descriptions</h3>
    <p className="text-justify">
      Title tags and meta descriptions are crucial for both search engines and users. Poorly optimized or missing title tags and meta descriptions can significantly impact your click-through rates and overall SEO performance.
    </p>
    <h4>How to Avoid This Mistake:</h4>
    <ul className="text-justify">
      <li>
        Create unique and descriptive title tags for each page, keeping them under 60 characters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write meta descriptions that summarize the content effectively and include primary keywords. Keep them under 150 characters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use tools like Yoast SEO or SEOPress to check the length and relevance of your title tags and meta descriptions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Keyword Stuffing</h3>
    <p className="text-justify">
      Overusing keywords in an attempt to rank higher is known as keyword stuffing. This practice not only makes your content less readable but can also lead to search engine penalties.
    </p>
    <h4>How to Avoid This Mistake:</h4>
    <ul className="text-justify">
      <li>
        Use keywords naturally within the content, ensuring they fit the context.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid repetitive use of the same keyword. Instead, use synonyms and related terms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Focus on providing value to your readers rather than over-optimizing for search engines.
      </li>
    </ul>
